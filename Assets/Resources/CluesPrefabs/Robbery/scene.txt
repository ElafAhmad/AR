The Apartment
Witness said that someone break into a room of the apartment, many things are missing include bag filled with $100k. Find out the truth and who is broke into the apartment.
There is no door or windows breaking sound, I heard a loud rifling, but I think it just someone missing a thing. I didn't think anything of it. Oh, I also heard someone footstep in hallway after that sound, it kind of sneaking footstep.
I'm the owner of that bag, It's Friday, I'm usually hang out with my friend and come back on 1am. I think it should be an insider because he broke into my room while I'm away.
While I reading a mag in my room, I heard a tinkering sound so I open the door to find the source. I saw someone run to the back door.
